## Installation
Download the `app.js` and `package.json` files to your local system. Then in the terminal, run the command `npm i` to install the file's required dependencies. After installing the dependencies, run the command `node app` in the terminal. This will start the program, and give the user prompts.

## Usage
The user will be given a series of prompts to answer regarding their employees. The employee types are `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern`. Each employee type has a different series of prompts that provide information about each employee. Once the user has completed entering all of their employees, they are prompted that their team is complete and a new HTML file has been created in a folder called `Output`. Open this file in a web browser to see the employee information website that has been created.
